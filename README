## Fake News Classification
#### Code Structure:

- API
    - / and /index: README
    - /start_training: Start training
    - /single_news_prediction : Single news prediction 
        - example: {"title":"Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley" ,
                    "text":"PALO ALTO, Calif.  â€”   After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists. A distinguished "

    where input should be in json format
    - /news_prediction: Multiple news prediction, 
    Where input would read from file, path provided at time of request
     if path not given then it would read input/test/* directory.
    news file must contain title and text column in csv format.
